# SemEval 2021 Task 8: MeasEval - Counts and Measurements
Counts and measurements are an important part of scientific discourse. It is relatively easy to find measurements in text, but a bare measurement like "17 mg" is not informative. However, relatively little attention has been given to parsing and extracting these important semantic relations. This is challenging because the way scientists write can be ambiguous and inconsistent, and the location of this information relative to the measurement can vary greatly.

MeasEval is a new entity and semantic relation extraction task focused on finding counts and measurements, attributes of these quantities, and additional information including measured entities, properties, and measurement contexts.
